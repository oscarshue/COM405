    // Task:
//Create a system that represents cards in a deck.
//The cards should have a number and a suit.
//The Deck class will hold the cards in a LinkedList.
//The Deck class should allow a card to be added to the Deck - when added, the card should be placed at the end of the deck.
//The class should also allow you to remove a card. The removed card should be taken from the top of the deck and returned by the method.
//        
//Further task
//Add a shuffle method to your deck class. This should change the order of the cards in your deck.
//How would you go about this?
//Hint. it will require a random number generator
